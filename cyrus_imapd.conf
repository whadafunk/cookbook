#####################################


#### GLOBAL IMAP SERVICE PARAMETERS ####

	servername: mails.see.lab
	serverinfo: on 
	maxlogins_per_host: 1
	maxlogins_per_user: 2
 # Maximum incoming lmtp message size in bytes. 0 disables the restriction
	maxmessage_size: 0

#### Paths and other system settings ####

 # The config directory is where we have mailboxes.db, backups, lock files, socket files,
 # and some other metadata that might be important to know of
 # These paths will differ from one distribution to another
 # Debian is using /var/lib/cyrus, while redhat/centos is using /var/lib/imap
	configdirectory: /var/lib/cyrus
 # Other than the previous parameter (configdirectory), the other paths are just fine
 # with the defaults	
	proc_path: /run/cyrus/proc
	mboxname_lockpath: /run/cyrus/lock
 # umask used by Cyrus programs
	umask: 077
 # Deleted mailboxes are prefixed as specified
	delete_prefix: DELETE
 # Deleted  mailboxes can be kept for a period of time (delayed)
	delete_mode: immediate

 # Partitions and spool configuration
	defaultpartition: default
	partition-default: /var/spool/cyrus/mail
 # The hashing helps with better distribution of the mailboxes over the configured partitions
 # There are some perl script to helo you with migration from hashed to unhashed and viceversa
 # dohash, undohash, rehash - /var/lib/cyrus-imapd
	hashimapspool: yes
	fulldirhash: yes

 # IMAP Namespace, is directly influenced by the following two settings.
 # The first one has to do only with the way mailboxes names are returned
 # at the imap list command, while the unixhierarchysep has to do with how 
 # these names are stored. 
 # To understand the concept of IMAP hierarchy, is similar to folder structure
 # The IMAP namespace is a hierarchy of folders separated by "." by default.
 # By using unixhierarchy separator, we can use the "." for the user name 
	altnamespace: yes
	unixhierarchysep: yes
 # These two are used when altnamespace is enabled
	userprefix: "Other Users"
	sharedprefix: "Shared Folders"


 # Rejecting illegal characters in headers
 # Headers of RFC2882 messages must not have characters with the 8th bit
 # set. However, too many badly-written MUAs generate this, including most
 # spamware. Enable this to reject such messages.
 	#reject8bit: yes
 # Replace 8bit characters with an "X"; That's what munge does
	munge8bit: yes
	lmtp_strict_rfc2821: 1
 # Normally email addresses are case sensitive, but using the parameter bellow
 # We can alter the case of the address before @ as small
	lmtp_downcase_rcpt: yes

 # If you disable permanent failure, the MTA will retry delivery at a later time
	lmtp_over_quota_perm_failure: 0
 # Enforcing strict quota, means the quota can never be reached, because a new message
 # That will raise the used space over the quota will not be accepted.
 # This also means that the user might not know why the messages are not getting in
	lmtp_strict_quota: 0


#### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION ####

 # Global admin users (for all services)
 # If specified with @domain, then administrative permissions will be granted only for that domain
 # Keep in mind that admin is the same as admin@default-domain
	admins: admin admin@see.lab admin@packets.cf admin@see.mgmt
 # Per/service admin users
	#lmtp_admins:
 	#mupdate_admins: mupdateman
	#imap_admins:  cyrus
	#sieve_admins: cyrus
	#proxyservers: cyrus

 # Authentication
 # You might want anonymous login for some shared mail folders (like public info)
 # In case you enable anonymous, don't forget to set the ACL for the anonymous ID
 # And also remember there is another special UserID, called anyone.
	username_tolower: 1
	allowanonymouslogin: no
 # Only the specified realms can log in.
	loginrealms: see.mgmt see.lab packets.cf
 # Off - disables virtuamdomains
 # userid - the domain part is determined from the userid
 # On - the domain part is determined from the userid or by doing a reverse dns
	virtdomains: userid
 # Unqualified users will be considered to be part of the default domain
 # The admin, specified in the admins is also apended with the default domain
 # You can log in with admin@see.mgmt and you will still have global admin rights
	defaultdomain: see.mgmt

 # SASL AUTHENTICATION #
 # Enables/Disables plaintext authentication mechanisms (PLAIN, LOGIN)
	allowplaintext: yes
	sasl_pwcheck_method: auxprop
	sasl_auxprop_plugin: sql
	sasl_sql_engine: mysql
	sasl_sql_hostnames: localhost
 # Use encrypted SSL SQL connection
	#sasl_sql_usessl: yes
	sasl_sql_database: email
	sasl_sql_user: email_admin
	sasl_sql_passwd: email_passnorth
	sasl_sql_select: SELECT UserPassword from email.credentials where AccountName = '%u' and Domain = '%r'
	sasl_mech_list: PLAIN LOGIN CRAM-MD5 DIGEST-MD5
	sasl_auto_transition: no
	#sasl_minimum_layer: 0
	#sasl_maximum_layer: 256

 # AUTO MAILBOXES AND QUOTA #
  
 # Allow normal user to add the anyone acl entry on their mailboxes
	anyoneuseracl: 0
 # Create the inbox and set quota automatically at login and when new message arrives;
 # -1 disable, 0 autocreate without quota, nnn autocreate and set quota
 # Quota is expressed in kilobytes
	autocreate_quota: -1
 # Create the inbox automatically when new message arrives
	autocreate_post: 0
	autocreate_quota_messages: -1
 
 # Only if the user doesn't have the INBOX already, and it has to be created
 # See bellow for autosubscription also
	autocreate_inbox_folders: Trash | Spam | Tickets

 # When automatically creating folders, also subscribe to them
	autocreate_subscribe_folders: Trash | Spam | Tickets
	autocreate_subscribe_sharedfolders: HR | Career

	defaultacl: anyone lrs


 # Sendmail binary location
 # DUE TO A BUG, Cyrus sends CRLF EOLs to this program. This breaks Exim 3. 
 # For now, to work around the bug, set this to a wrapper that calls 
 # /usr/sbin/sendmail -dropcr instead if you use Exim 3.
 # sendmail: /usr/sbin/sendmail

 # If enabled, cyrdeliver will look for Sieve scripts in user's home
 # directories: ~user/.sieve.

 # notifyd(8) method to use for "MAIL" notifications.  If not set, "MAIL"
 # notifications are disabled.  Valid methods are: null, log, zephyr
	#mailnotifier: zephyr

 # notifyd(8) method to use for "SIEVE" notifications.  If not set, "SIEVE"
 # notifications are disabled.  This method is only used when no method is
 # specified in the script.  Valid methods are null, log, zephyr, mailto
